          The Speech and language development in children is a critical aspect 
          of their cognitive and social growth. Numerous studies have highlighted
          the importance of early intervention in addressing speech delays and
          disorders. Traditional speech therapy typically involves face-to-face
          sessions with speech-language pathologists (SLPs), but this method often
          poses challenges such as limited accessibility, high costs, and
          inconsistent follow-ups. Research by Paul et al. (2015) emphasized that
          timely therapy significantly improves articulation, fluency, and
          comprehension, especially during early childhood when language acquisition
          is at its peak.

          The rise of mobile health (mHealth) technologies has paved the way for
          digital interventions in speech therapy. Recent advancements show that
          mobile apps and virtual tools can complement conventional therapy by
          providing interactive, at-home exercises. A study by Kaipa and Peterson
          (2016) revealed that children using tablet-based speech therapy applications
          demonstrated measurable improvements in articulation and vocabulary usage. 
          Furthermore, digital tools allow therapists to remotely monitor a child's
          progress and adjust therapy plans accordingly, bridging gaps in care continuity.

         Machine learning and artificial intelligence are also being integrated into speech
         therapy platforms. These technologies enable real-time feedback, adaptive learning paths,
         and progress tracking, which enhances both therapist and patient engagement. For example,
         research by Ruan et al. (2019) developed an AI-driven model to assess pronunciation 
         accuracy,which showed promising results in identifying speech sound errors. Such models are
         particularly useful in scaling speech therapy to underserved populations.

        In the context of Sri Lanka and similar regions, the demand for accessible and 
        cost-effective speech therapy tools is growing. While some international 
        platforms exist, there is a clear gap in localized, culturally relevant solutions
        tailored to children s needs. This project aims to address this gap by developing
        an Integrated Mobile Speech Therapy Platform that allows parents and therapists 
        to create customized therapy plans, monitor child progress statistically, and ensure 
        consistent engagement through interactive activities. The use of Java, Python,
        and trained models aligns with current best practices in digital health development.
