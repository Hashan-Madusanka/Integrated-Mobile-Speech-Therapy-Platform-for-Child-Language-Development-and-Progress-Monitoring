        The proposed methodology focuses on developing an integrated mobile speech 
        therapy platform tailored for children with speech impairments. The system
        will begin with a data collection phase, where input such as age, speech 
        disorder type, and symptoms will be gathered. A diagnostic module powered 
        by image processing and trained machine learning models (e.g., CNN/YOLOv8) 
        will analyze facial and speech patterns to detect issues like cleft palate. 
        Based on the diagnosis, a personalized therapy plan will be generated using 
        an adaptive learning algorithm that adjusts tasks dynamically based on performance.
        The system will include interactive therapy exercises, real-time progress tracking,
        and auditory feedback to maintain engagement. Parents and therapists can monitor
        improvements through visual dashboards. The mobile platform will be developed
        using Java (for app logic), Python (for backend AI models), and Firebase for 
        authentication and data storage. Continuous testing and user feedback will guide
        iterative improvements for accuracy and usability.
