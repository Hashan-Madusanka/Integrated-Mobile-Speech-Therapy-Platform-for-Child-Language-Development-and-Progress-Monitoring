      <h1>Research Problem</h1>
      <ul class="custom-list">
        <li>
          Lack of Diagnosis and Monitoring Tools in Existing Speech Therapy Apps
          Current apps like Katha and Avaz lack built-in features for diagnosing
          specific speech difficulties (e.g., cleft palate, language delay) and do
          not provide continuous monitoring of mouth behavior, which limits early 
          and accurate intervention.<br />
        </li>

        <li>
          Absence of Adaptive and Personalized Therapy Plans Most applications 
          follow a one-size-fits-all approach, failing to dynamically adjust therapy
          content based on the individual child's development, performance, and
          evolving needs, causing therapy to be either too easy or too difficult.<br />
        </li>

        <li>
          Limited Integration of Engaging Content with Therapy Goals Existing platforms do
          not combine interactive exercises (e.g., games, animations) with therapeutic 
          objectives in a way that keeps children consistently motivated and aligned with 
          clinical goals.
        </li>

        <li>
          Low Parental Involvement and Real-Time Feedback Mechanisms Parents are often excluded
          from the therapy process due to lack of features that allow supervision, progress tracking,
          or real-time feedback, leading to ineffective at-home therapy sessions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Infrequency of Clinical Sessions and Lack of Continuous Support Due to limited therapist 
          availability and infrequent sessions (e.g., monthly), children experience delays in interventions,
          and parents are left without sufficient tools or knowledge to support consistent therapy at home.
        </li>

        <li>Lack of Real-Time Progress Tracking and Data Visualization Current systems do not offer tools
            to visualize therapy progress or highlight specific problem areas over time, making it difficult 
            for therapists and parents to adjust treatment strategies effectively.</li>
