      <h1>Research Gap</h1>
      <p>
        Despite advancements in speech therapy technologies, there remains
        a significant gap in providing a fully integrated, personalized, and
        culturally relevant mobile speech therapy platform for children.
        Most existing applications lack customization features that adapt
        therapy content to individual developmental needs, often applying generic
        solutions.  
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, these apps fail to incorporate real-time feedback,
        parental involvement, and progress tracking, which are vital for
        continuous improvement. In the Sri Lankan context, the problem is compounded
        by the lack of localized tools tailored to native language phonological
        structures and low-resource rural environments.

        Existing systems like Avaz,though impactful, are region-specific and not fully
        suited to the linguistic and therapeutic needs of Sinhala-speaking children. 
        Therefore, a crucial research gap lies in developing an adaptive, AI-driven 
        mobile platform that offers personalized therapy plans, tracks progress in real time, 
        supports parental supervision, and caters specifically to Sri Lanka’s linguistic and cultural
        landscape—bridging both global limitations and local challenges.
