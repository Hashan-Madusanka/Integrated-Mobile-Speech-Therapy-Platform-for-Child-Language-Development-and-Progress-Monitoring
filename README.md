# Integrated-Mobile-Speech-Therapy-Platform-for-Child-Language-Development-and-Progress-Monitoring
A mobile speech therapy platform for children aged 1 to 4, diagnosing and monitoring speech disorders while improving communication through personalized therapy and real-time progress tracking.

# Overview of the Project 

The Integrated Mobile Speech Therapy Platform for Child Language Development and Progress Monitoring aims to provide children aged 1-4 with speech difficulties—such as cleft palate, language delay, and hearing loss—with personalized, engaging, and adaptive therapy interventions. The platform integrates mobile-based interactive tools, leveraging advanced technologies like YOLO object detection and adaptive learning algorithms for real-time feedback and progressive therapy plans.
